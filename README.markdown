## dotfiles

This is based off of [@holman's](http://github.com/holman/) [dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles)

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine. 

This is a mix of files for OS X & Linux, bash, Ruby, Rails, git, homebrew, TextMate, vim. If you match up along most of those lines, you may want to fork my dotfiles.

This setup avoids long alias files and everything strewn about (which is extremely common in other dotfiles projects, too). That lead [@holman](http://github.com/holman/) to create his [dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles) project which is much more topic-centric. [@holman](http://github.com/holman/) split a lot of things up into the main areas he used (Ruby, git, system libraries, and so on), and structured the project accordingly.

If you're interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these are awesome, you might want to [read @holman's post on the subject](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).

## install

- `git clone git://github.com/wmernagh/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `rake install`

The install rake task will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your
home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`,
though.

###rails
- `s` pings your system for any running Rails apps, and `deathss` will then
  kill all of them indiscriminately. `ss` starts up a new Rails server on the
  next available port- if 3000 is taken, it'll spin up your server on 3001.

###system
- `c` is an autocomplete shortcut to your projects directory. For example, `c
  git` and then hitting tab will autocomplete to `github`, and then it simply
  changes to my `github` directory.
- `check [filename]` is a quick script that tells you whether a domain is
  available to register.
- `smartextract [filename]` will extract about a billion different
  compressed/uncompressed/whatever files and you'll never have to remember the
  syntax.
- `backup` is a quick hook into `rsync` to backup a selection of files. Check
  out the comments for more details.

###fun
- `cloudapp` uploads any file to [CloudApp](http://getcloudapp.com).
- `gifme` is a command-line animated GIF generator. It's also amazing.

##moar custom
There are a few things I use to make my life awesome. They're not a required
dependency, but if you make it happen, THEY'LL MAKE **YOU** HAPPEN.

- If you want some more colors for things like `ls`, install grc: `brew install
  grc`.
- If you install the excellent [rvm](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com) to manage
  multiple rubies, your current branch will show up in the prompt. Bonus.

## thanks
This is based off of [@holman's](http://github.com/holman/) wonderful [dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles) which are ZSH based. I have modified them to be BASH based.

[@holman](http://github.com/holman/) forked [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb)' excellent [dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) for a couple years before the weight of his changes and tweaks inspired him to finally roll his own. But Ryan's dotfiles were an easy way to get into bash customization, and then to jump ship to zsh a bit later. A decent amount of the code in these dotfiles stem or are inspired from Ryan's original project.
